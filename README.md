#Joke Rating Website

This project is working on building a website that is made avaiable for the user to create an account and post jokes, read and rate other users joke. This is like a joke community website.

Project uses Multiple web application languages such as HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript for building the static webpages and include some functionality to those webpages. Moreover, JS is being used for sanity checking for the users data being inputted, and rejecting all illegible data and preventing injection of data to the Database.

Project uses PHP and AJAX for the server side coding and implementing a connection between the database and website. Moreover, AJAX is being used to asynchronously update the webpages and create more dynamic and responsive website for the user.

MySQL Database is being implemented to store the users data, with the 2NF and 3NF normalization technique to avoid injection of illegible data and making data more secure from being loss.
