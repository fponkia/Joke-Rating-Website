#Joke Rating Website

This project is working on building a website that is made available for the user to create an account and post jokes, and read and rate other users' jokes. This is like a joke community website.

The project uses multiple web application languages such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to build static web pages and include some functionality in those web pages. Moreover, JS is being used for sanity checking for the user's data being inputted, and rejecting all illegible data, and preventing injection of data to the Database.

The project uses PHP and AJAX for server-side coding and the implementation of a connection between the database and the website. Moreover, AJAX is used to update the web pages asynchronously and create more dynamic and responsive websites for the user.

MySQL Database is being implemented to store the users' data, with the 2NF and 3NF normalization techniques to avoid injection of illegible data and make data more secure from being lost.

Due to the closure of the hosting server, the website cannot fully work on the new hosting site due to the serverless state of the vercel but can be reached to the site to view the front-end through this link: https://rating-website.vercel.app/api/homepage.php
